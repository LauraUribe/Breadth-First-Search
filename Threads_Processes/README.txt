RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

For both my processes and thread, the clock captures the start and the end of the number of processes or threads run. For example, in my processes code, the number of threads inputted was 4. The total clock time in milliseconds is 951. This is the number of milliseconds it takes for the code to run the total number of threads inputted. In real time, it takes  0.004 seconds. When I run the processes code and the number of processes inputted is 4, the total clock time is 516, where the real time is 0.004 seconds. In this example, with so little processes or threads inputted, neither processes or threads are faster than the other.
